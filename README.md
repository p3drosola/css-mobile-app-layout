css-mobile-app-layout
=================

As we all know HTML + CSS were designed for styling documents. 
Building an application layout where the screen is split up into various areas, vertically and horizontally is not easy. 
Especially as those areas start expanding, collapsing & scrolling.

Buy using [display:table](http://caniuse.com/css-table), absolute positiong, and nesting elements properly we can arrive at a workable solution. 
This is not a revolutionary concept. It's more like "let me just put it here so I'll use it next time, instead of spending an hour figuring it out". 
And maybe it'll save you some time too.
